<h3 class="font-weight-light">Hello, I’m <span class="font-weight-bold">{{site.author.name}}</span></h3>

I created this website to **connect game designers of different specializations with what's been going on in academic research**. And I also love talking about video games, so why not hitting two birds with one stone?

#### Bits about me
I'm a video game researcher & information science PhD student born and raised in Czechia, Europe, but currently residing in New York, USA. I've always loved video games and the game culture, so studying it is pretty much a dream job! My passion is also sharing fun and cool facts from research with people around me, which is pretty much why I created this website. #sharingiscaring

Research-wise, I've been always interested in how people make sense of technologies around them and how their experience is designed. This has naturally led me from analysing social media data over to algorithms more broadly, which eventually landed me in figuring out **how people make sense of the game AI**. **I focus on understanding how gamers perceive NPCs in video games and what strategies they develop, for example in the combat gameplay**.

Video games that excites me the most are the ones which put players in the center of their design by creating an immersive experience. Since immersion is closely connected to human-like NPCs and realistic game worlds, that's also the broader interest of my research. 

#### Which games I play, you asked? 

Mostly RPGs and story-driven games! *The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt*, *Life is Strange*, *A Plague Tale: Innocence*, you name it.

I started playing video games when I was 5 and stopped as a teenager around the time the first *Mass Effect* came out. I returned to video games after 15 years (as a player and researcher) through *Call of Duty Mobile*, and hidden objects & mini-puzzles *Lost Lands* game series. I am a huge fan (and therefore lowkey biased towards) video games developed by CD Projekt RED, The Witcher series being my ultimate favorite. 

#### “I’m a bit of a game designer myself.”

Outside of the academia, I make sure to let people know researchers are fun people to hang out with! I also do my best to learn the ropes of game design, level design being my favorite spec. I’m overall an artistic person so I get a kick from creating something from scratch that could make people happy: watercolor painting, digital art, crafting, anything of the sorts.
